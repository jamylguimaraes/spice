WELCOME TO SPICE
=================================

This is a very small PHP framework using MVC design pattern. For better understanding I have created an address book using spice framwork.
Now I am going to demonstrate how this small and tiny framework can meet your requirement.


CONFIGURATION
=============

To process user need to follow these steps: 

1. Go to phpmyadmin and create a database named `spice`; 
2. Now import the `spice.sql` file to the database.
3. Go to system/config file. You need to set base url like `http://localhost/spice/` or what you might feet.
4. Now set the database host. Usually it's `localhost`, database name is `spice` or the name you have created, the user is the database user name and set the password. 

Your done!

GO TO the browser and then visit something like http://localhost/spice/ 

Enjoy :)
